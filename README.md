# FindDocumentContainingWord
This was an old file that I made when my father needed help finding a file which he only knew a single word in it.

Right now it works by using a folder called "LookupTest" which is localized. This was done because at the time I thought that there was no universal path to the desktop of document section for security reasons... but there is. So in a future update this will be non localized.
